# Cutters :haircut:

Get Cutters hair salons sorted by wait time in the terminal.

```
$ npx cutters | grep Oslo | head -3
Oslo City                     Oslo          2 min    2 waiting
Stortingsgata                 Oslo          8 min    1 waiting

Just run this:

```
npx cutters
```

Or install it first, if that's your style:

```
npm i -g cutters
cutters
```

```
npx cutters |Â grep Oslo | head -3
```
